# Employee-HR
My classmate and I created this project while learning C#. This project created a windows desktop application using Window Presentation Foundation (WPF) technology incorporated with .NET to build an internal HR-purposed application to keep track of employees. This application has the ability of CRUD operations on employees as well as adding expenses, sorting and searching for employees, and giving promotions. In this project, I learned about the Agile method, extensive use of version control (git), and the MVC model of software development.
